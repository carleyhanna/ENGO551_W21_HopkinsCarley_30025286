This website is about my interests and hobbies.

It contains 4 pages and a homepage.
One of the pages contains a list of all the places I have gone backcountry camping, which are linked to the all trails with the routes I hiked. The background image I took while backcountry camping.
The second page is of the sports I do regularly, and includes a picture I took while hiking.
The third page is a table containing my top 10 favorite music albums, along with their artist creator and the album cover.
The final page is a second table, listing SCUBA dives I would like to do and details about it.

All pages are linked to a stylesheet that adds or removes a border based on screen size. 
The same stylesheet makes text centered, and a certain font.
The sport page contains an additional stylesheet link.
The CSS selectors utilized are: #id, .class, group selector, * and element.
The CSS properties utilized are: background, text-align, font-family, color, and border-bottom

Bootstrap is incorporated on every page, using the grid format to layout the hyperlinks to each other page.
Bootstrap is also used to create a banner/jumbotron on the homepage.

SCSS is used on the SCUBA page to incorporate an SCSS variable via text-align, SCSS nesting to set the background colour, and the SCSS Inheritance to create a button.
